# Privacy Policy for ScreenshotMatcher Android App

## App Owner

The ScreenshotMatcher android application is developed by Alexander Weichart, Thomas Fischer and Andreas Schmid of the junior research group "Physical-Digital Affordances" at the University of Regensburg.
The complete source code is licensed under the MIT license and thus open to the public.

## Camera Access

ScreenshotMatcher works by photographing a PC screen with the smartphone camera, capturing a screenshot on the PC, finding the photographed region within the screenshot, and sending the result back to the phone.
Therefore, access to the device's camera is required for the smartphone app.
However, image data is only transferred between phone and PC locally via a WiFi connection.
Image data is at no time sent over the internet and nobody besides the user has access to image data.

Consent to access the camera is voluntary but required to use ScreenshotMatcher.
Revoking access afterwards is possible, however no new images can be captured until access is granted again.

## Data Collection

By default, neither app nor desktop counterpart contain any form of telemetry.
Users can activate telemetry in the app's settings to allow the application to send log data to the developers.
Those logs are anonymous and contain the following:
 * timestamp for the log and for several sub-processes within the application
 * unique user ID
 * information about the user's operating system and screen resolution
 * information about settings in the app
 * information on whether the app could successfully capture a picture and how the user proceeded with the picture (save, share)
This log process is completely volotary and no images are sent to the developers at any time.

## Purpose of Data Collection

The log data's only purpose is to provide developers insights on the reliability of the app in a real-life context.

## Third Parties

No third parties will have access to log data.

## User's Rights

Users can request insights into their log data by contacting the developers.
This way, they can also request deletion of their data.

## Notification of Changes or Updates to the Privacy Policy

We do not plan to change the privacy policy for ScreenshotMatcher.
In case there is need to update the privacy policy, we will roll out a new version of the app and inform users via the app description in the playstore and a popup window upon startup of the app.

## Effective Date

This privacy policy is effecive from 2021-10-14.
