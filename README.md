#  ScreenshotMatcher (WIP)

Oftentimes, taking photographs of a computer screen is preferred to capturing proper screenshots as it is fast, convenient and the picture is shared via the smartphone anyway.
However, image artifacts such as moir√© patterns, reflections, and perspective distortion deteriorate image quality of such photos.
ScreenshotMatcher solves this problem by using the interaction technique of photographing a screen with the phone to capture high quality screenshots which are already cropped to the region of interest.
This is done by automatically capturing a screenshot on the PC, detecting and extracting the photographed region of interest with a feature matching algorithm and sending the result to the smartphone.
ScreenshotMatcher consists of a python program running on the PC and an Android application.

## State of the project

The project is in a late development stage.
All major features work, but there is still some refactoring, bugfixing and documentation to be done.
